    <section id="about">
        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Matt. I'm 30 and I live in North London. I've got a dog called Pepper who I love more than anything. My hobbies include walking Pepper, playing drums, watching cricket and going to nice restaurants with my other half.</p>
        <p>Early in 2024, I decided to take the plunge into Web and Software Development with the aim of securing a role with more freedom to work anywhere in the world, more creative and challenging work and (let's not beat around the bush) the potential to earn good money.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Overview of my career so far and career aspirations.</h3>
        <p>After almost a decade of retail work (most of which spent as Assistant Store Manager level - the best level to be at) while trying to break into the media industry, I finally stumbled upon a YouTube Channel Coordinator role with Moonbug Entertainment, the owners of now the most successful kids TV show in the world, CoComelon.</p>
        <p>During my time at Moonbug, I've been promoted twice, and now lead the strategy on some of our mid-level shows, Gecko's Garage and Oddbods. I line manage 5 junior colleagues and I also help out our Dev team in planning, testing and launching new tools and softwares.</p>
        <p>Following on from that last point, I'm now looking at roles which can combine my skills learned so far - Excel, data analysis, project management, presenting, leading a team - and combining it with my newly learned skills in software.</p>
        <p>My ideal roles would be either Data Analyst or a QA Tester. I'm a very good communicator, I love working in teams and I really like graphs and numbers. I'm also great fun at dinner parties, in case it wasn't obvious.</p>
